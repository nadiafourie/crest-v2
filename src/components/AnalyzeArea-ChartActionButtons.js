/*
Purpose
  The component holds all the action buttons for each chart/area. Each chart are the zonal set of statistics for an Area
  the user-designated on the map.

  The button is one of the following:
   - more/less (more provides all the detailed charts, less and the default is the summary map)
   - export (the map to png/svg)
   - zoom (zoom/pan the map to the area)
   - Remove Area (removes the area from the map)

   Do we need to decide of the button action happens here?
