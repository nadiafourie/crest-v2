  Individual button for the charts held in AnalyzeArea-ChartActionButtons.js

  The button is one of the following:
   - more/less (more proivdes all the detailed charts, less and the default is the summary map)
   - export (the map to png/svg)
   - zoom (zoom/pan the map to the area)
   - Remove Area (removes the area from the map)
