/*
Purpose
  The component holds all the chart and action buttons. This should be the summary chart only.

  There are four buttons which include
    - Sort (sorts data from high to low or low to high. sort will display a menu to choose sort order and sort field)
    - Export All (exports all the maps to png/svg (if in graph mode) or the data to CSV (if in table mode). will display a menu for the user to pick which format)
    - Graph/table (toggles graph or table mode)
    - Remove All (Removes all areas from map and anaylsis results area)

    We need to decide if the button action happens here?
