/*
Purpose
  There are two types of groups the drivers and the main layers, for lack of not knowing what to call them.
  The drivers, in this case, will need to be collapsible

  This will change when regions change 

  might be able to merge this with MapLayerList-LayerGroup have collapsible as true and as sub menue for background color change

  has only the layers that are grouped with the main layer such as which can change for different layers
  Community Asset Inputs
    - Critical Facilities
    - Critical Infrastructure
    - etc

  Threat Inputs
    - Areas of Low Slope
    - etc

  we should probably use a config as we did in v1
